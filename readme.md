## Description

App is the most important directory in this repo. To run it locally, go into the app directory and install gulp dependencies. You'll get serve ( also live reloading via browser-sync ) and build processes. Otherwise, no libraries are used in this project, just good old Javascript.

 ``` 
 cd circular-slider
 ```
 ``` 
 cd app
 ```
 
``` 
npm i
```
 
 Express server just servers static files, so nothing special here. To run it:
 
 ``` 
 cd circular-slider
 ```
 
 ``` 
 node run
 ```
